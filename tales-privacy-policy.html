            <h1>Privacy and terms of use</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) provides important information regarding Tales in
                respect to user information collected through our mobile applications and the use of the
                information.</p>

            <h1>1. Personal and non-personal information:</h1>
            <p>We understand the importance of our users’ personal information, and more importantly
                the information pertaining to children under 13 years of age. We do not collect or require
                users to enter their personal information when using our Products. We do not collect any
                personal information from children with our Products.</p>
            <p>In our ad-supported apps our third-party Ad SDK's may use the IP address and mobile
                advertising ID of your device in order to show non-personalized ads. Please refer to our Data
                Policy below for details, including how to opt out of such usage.</p>

            <h1>2. COPPA:</h1>
            <p>We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not knowingly
                collect personal information on children under the age of 13. When a user identifies himself or
                herself as a child under the age of 13 through a support request or through any feedback, we
                will not collect, store or use, and will delete in a secure manner, any personal information of
                such user.</p>

            <h1>3. Data retention:</h1>
            <p>If we do happen to obtain any personal information, including emails or phone numbers
                perhaps obtained through support requests or other correspondence, it will be treated with the
                strictest confidentiality. Any such personal information will never be shared with any other
                entities. Any such personal information will not be retained beyond the resolution of the
                support request or other correspondence.</p>

            <h1>4. Anonymous usage information:</h1>
            <p>Our apps and websites may collect anonymous usage information to help improve the
                quality of our services and applications.</p>

            <h1>5. Internet permissions:</h1>
            <p>Our apps do typically require internet permissions, for the purpose of providing links to
                the app store entry of our products and to collect anonymous usage information (see above).</p>

            <h1>6. In-app purchases:</h1>
            <p>Our apps may contain in-app purchases (IAP’s).</p>

            <h1>7. Advertising:</h1>
            <p>Some of our apps contain third-party advertising. We may occasionally promote other
                products of our own within our apps. We may occasionally cross-promote the products of
                other affiliated developers that offer similar products and share similar values as expressed
                on their own published privacy policies.</p>

            <h1>8. Social media:</h1>
            <p>Our apps do not interact with any social media sites. We may provide links to our own
                social media sites for the purpose of providing support and product information.</p>

            <h1>Data Policy</h1>

            <h1>9. Advirtising:</h1>
            <p>Many of our apps use advertising to provide the content free of charge. When you use
                these apps your device automatically sends certain information to our advertising partners
                AdMob, AppLovin, IronSource and Unity Ads. This information includes, for example, the name of the app, the
                device type, and the advertising ID.</p>
            <p>The information gathered is solely used to provide our advertising partners with the bare
                minimum of information they need to provide their services and combat click fraud. Within the
                EU, we serve house ads which collects zero data, non-personalized ads, or collect consent
                via the Unity Ads SDK.</p>
